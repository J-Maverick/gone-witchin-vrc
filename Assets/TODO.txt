hotspots for certain fish

"reward player for further cast"

Shared potion Inventory system

Fish revamp?
 - Behavior properties: Force disturbance with different frequency properties -- simple fourier series, tunable fish to fish
  - This could be for both catch and general travel
  - Up and down on low frequency -- capped 
  - Add vector for influencing weights on travel direction (this fish seems to like to stay over by the dam, or by the boat, etc.)

Fish scale
leaderboard
	- Fish are counted when put on the scale or when tossed in the pipe
	- Jingle for high score?

================================AUDIO============================================

Bottle Pouring

Reagent Pouring

Cauldron success? Indicator: add success audio option, also failure sound for cauldron?

Fishing
 - Reeling
 - Casting
 - Giving Line
 - Slack
 - Fish On
 - Fish Fight splashing
 - Catch splash


================================IMPLEMENTED============================================

fish vibration on rod, tick only on reel

Rod Upgrade

Day/night cycle

Craftable bait

===============BUGS===================

slide around after jumping???

grabbing fish fron someone elses  rod fucks thingsnup

bait board didnt update from remote
corker broke

stove only works for master

remote player bobber teleport??? seems like some sort of collision issue causing bobber to respawn

size-based stats are still enabled
someone left and fish snapped back onto the hook
bottle snaps need tuning
no gong for remotes players
pipes dont sync again

Cube and moon bottles have pretty bad fill levels

caught fish getting stuck ???

"respawning fish" still exist after being removed

"the gone witchin lag spike"

bottle spawns at old location???
 
things blow up in peoples hands sometimes

lots of bottles fuck up directional audio and voice

caught a lot of fish and stopped getting bites, remote player fixed it

===============Possibly Fixed Bugs to Test=============

catch distance too high on rod upgrades

bottle despawn visible

bait on hook desync

late join fishpole/bobber desync location big lag  -- frames recovered when I became master (everyone left)

extreme late join corker died? also dupes still a thing (very high ping consistently duped)

fast or highly stretched bobbers cause some lag

late joiner recipe desync

full bottle of mystery liquid name empty bottle -- it happens at spawn. it was eyedrops, so maybe it happens at corker ffff
 
elevators spin the shit out of you

potion duping

======================FIXED===================

adding extra bait endpoints made the buttons stop working

high fps pours more from cauldron for less potion

remote bobber wiggle

spawned pipes just delete fish

apprentice bait visual bug? 

portable pipe doesnt work remote

late join rod spaz fishing line

adding fish to pipe straight from pole breaks the pole

Caught bottles show up as fish for other players
