fish vibration on rod, tick only on reel

Rod Upgrade

Day/night cycle

===============BUGS===================

Cube and moon bottles have pretty bad fill levels

caught fish getting stuck ???

"respawning fish" still exist after being removed

"the gone witchin lag spike"

bottle spawns at old location???
 
things blow up in peoples hands sometimes

lots of bottles fuck up directional audio and voice

caught a lot of fish and stopped getting bites, remote player fixed it

===============Possibly Fixed Bugs to Test=============

catch distance too high on rod upgrades

bottle despawn visible

bait on hook desync

late join fishpole/bobber desync location big lag  -- frames recovered when I became master (everyone left)

extreme late join corker died? also dupes still a thing (very high ping consistently duped)

fast or highly stretched bobbers cause some lag

late joiner recipe desync

full bottle of mystery liquid name empty bottle -- it happens at spawn. it was eyedrops, so maybe it happens at corker ffff
 
elevators spin the shit out of you

potion duping

======================FIXED===================

remote bobber wiggle

spawned pipes just delete fish

apprentice bait visual bug? 

portable pipe doesnt work remote

late join rod spaz fishing line

adding fish to pipe straight from pole breaks the pole

Caught bottles show up as fish for other players
